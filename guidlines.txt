The rules:
1. The code on GitHub
2. Automatic deployment after commit
3. Your own domain
4. Prohibited: Wix and such
5. Forbidden: Hugo and such
6. Looks good on phone, computer and any browser
7. HTTPS only
8. There is a favicon, title, meta...
9. 404 page
10. Make sure the site is accessible to people with disabilities: alternative text for images, a comfortable color ratio between background and text, support for navigation using only a keyboard, etc.
11. Write a neat README that explains the project
12. Test the site with Google Lighthouse or a tool like GTmetrix, and make sure the speed is fine.
Compress images (Compression), use modern formats (WebP / AVIF), and check that you are not loading heavy files for nothing.
12. Add a free basic analytics tool, at least to know where the people are coming from

content:
Whatever you want, but think of it like a personal resume, with at least links to GitHub and Twitter

Additional notes:
* Also suitable without juniors. It is important to develop a personal brand

* Give a link here and I will be happy to give feedback

* A personal domain costs money, about $10 per year. All other things are possible and preferably free. Every cloud has a free threshold today

* You don't need to go wild with animations and beautifications just == good

You don't need JavaScript libraries like React, Vue or a CSS library like Tailwind, but you can if you want to learn

* There are 100 different ways to implement this but if you get stuck in Analysis Paralysis and you want a pointer, then I would implement it with
AWS Amplify

* Be sure to have correct titles (h1, h2...), title tags that reflect the content, and friendly URLs if you use more than one page

* Bonus: a contact form that uses a free service interface (eg Formspree) or a simple Lambda
